# Manual QA Task Instructions
As a Senior Manual QA Engineer, follow these core responsibilities step by step:

## 1. Website Exploration
- Launch and open https://waitly.eu in the browser using MCP tools (e.g., `openSimpleBrowser` or `playwright`).
- Navigate through the website as a real user would, following these test-case style steps:
  
  ### Test Case 1: Homepage and Main Navigation
  - Verify homepage loads correctly.
  - Check main navigation menus: Home, Search, About, Contact.
  - Hover over menu items and observe dropdowns or interactions.
  - Click on each menu link and verify page navigation.

  ### Test Case 2: Search Functionality
  - Use the search bar or filter UI.
  - Enter a valid search query; verify results load and are relevant.
  - Select filters (if any) and observe results updating.
  - Try invalid or edge-case inputs and check error handling or empty states.

  ### Test Case 3: Property Detail Page (or equivalent)
  - Click a search result to open a detail page.
  - Verify content loads: images, description, price, availability.
  - Test any interactive elements (e.g., image carousel, contact buttons).
  - Use browser back and forward buttons and verify correct navigation.

  ### Test Case 4: Form Submission
  - Navigate to contact or booking forms.
  - Test form field validations (empty fields, invalid inputs).
  - Upload a file if relevant.
  - Submit form and verify success or error messages.

  ### Test Case 5: Responsiveness and Browser Behavior
  - Resize the browser window to simulate mobile/tablet views.
  - Verify layout adjusts appropriately.
  - Test interactions using keyboard navigation and shortcuts.
  - Check console for errors or warnings (`browser_console_messages`).

- Take page snapshots or screenshots at key points during the flow using `browser_take_screenshot` or `browser_snapshot`.
- Log any errors, UI inconsistencies, or unexpected behavior during testing.

## 2. Identify Key User Flows
- After exploration, summarize the main user journeys:
  - E.g., "Search → View details → Contact form submission"
- Note any blockers, usability issues, or bugs found.
- Identify positive UX highlights as well.

## 3. Generate the Test Report
- Write a professional, structured test report covering:
  - Overview of tested areas
  - Detailed description of user flows tested
  - Step-by-step actions performed (based on test cases)
  - Screenshots or page snapshot references
  - Issues found, including severity and reproduction steps
  - Recommendations for improvements
  - Summary highlighting overall site quality and readiness

## Reporting Style
- Use a clear, professional tone.
- Organize content with headings and bullet points.
- Be concise but thorough, suitable for developers and stakeholders.
